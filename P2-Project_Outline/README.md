## Submission Instructions

### Overview

This idea came from a problem that I wanted to solve for myself, I recently inherited my grandma's big box of recipes and I wanted to record them digitally so I could keep them safe and share them with others. I think there are people in similar situations who would benefit from an app like this. 

This app allows users to create, browse, share, and search for recipes. It will be their own personal recipe box. 

### Features

- Create Recipe: Users will be able to log their recipe, instructions, and a picture to create a unique webpage for their recipe. 
- Seach Recipe: Users will be able to search for specific recipes. 
- User Login: Users will be able to create an account and profile. 
- Share Recipe: Users will be able to share a recipe on other platforms. 
- Public profile page
